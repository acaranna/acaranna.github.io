          <h3>Jam is One of the Oldest Foods in the World</h3>
          <p>The earliest humans preserved foods for storage. Storing fruits was especially key, so they could continue eating fruit and its nutrients during the colder months.<br><br> Though food historians are pretty sure that people made preserves much earlier, the earliest record of people making jam comes from 6000 B.C.E., from the present day Middle East. They documented themselves harvesting honey to preserve fruits such as figs, apricots, and quinces.</p>
